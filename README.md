## Councilmatic

Councilmatic is a web application that pulls information about bills, representatives, and events from the city and displays it in an easy to consume way for anyone looking for this information.

Champion: Dan Fey (https://github.com/feydan)

Help needed:
- Python experience

Resources:
There are three projects that need to be hosted together and configured to interact
1. https://github.com/opencivicdata/scrapers-us-municipal/pull/243 - Scrapers pull information from the City of Sacramento's Legistar site and save it into a Postgres Database
2. https://github.com/opencivicdata/imago - Open Civic Data (OCD) Api pulls from the Postgres Database and publishes the information via API
3. https://github.com/datamade/councilmatic-starter-template - Pulls the data from the OCD Api, saves it into a Postgres database, and displays the information -- this is the councilmatic web application and front-end.  There's a Sacramento fork, but it may need updating: https://github.com/code4sac/sacramento-councilmatic

PR for Sacramento Changes: https://github.com/opencivicdata/scrapers-us-municipal/pull/243

## BankON Sacramento

Bank Onâ€™s goal is to ensure that everyone has access to a safe and affordable bank or credit union account.  This project is building a map of branches that offer these accounts to be displayed on United Way's website.  We'd like this for Sacramento, but it would be great to support mapping nation wide.
